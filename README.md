|---------------------------------(end #1)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 2 (September 30, 2017):

Started on creating some user stories (Prof and student). Visit 'Trello Board'
to see the written user stories on backlog card. Narrowed down the main idea
of how the project will precede during the development by reviewing the current
stories with overlapping features directly or indirectly.

Ran into some complications with user stories/requirements and came up with
some questions for the client to get a better understanding of how to proceed
with the current project.
  -> Requesting a meeting with the client (Professor) some time next week
     for some clarification of end-user requirements.

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 0:50:58

|---------------------------------(end #2)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 3 (October 14, 2017):

Started on creating and finalizing the personas based on the user stories from
last meeting. See Available document from the path linked above. Narrowed down
all personas by revising all created personas to match a realistic sense who
will be using the application that ties in with the corresponding course (in this
case it will be stats).

		- For the professor personas, one of them must have some attributes that
		  relate to Professor Sohee Kang, e.g. her method to teaching, attitude
		  towards using software, perferences, daily activity (avg time to
		  respond to email, frequency of uploading course notes and problem sets).
		  As for the other pofessor personas, they must have some other traits that
		  contrasts (can have some overlaying traits) a persona like Sohee Kang but
		  must be based off realistic sense of other professors that teach the same
		  course.

		- For the students personas there must be 3 unique types. One of the
		  peresonas must be an average student who's traits represents most of the
		  students who takes the course by underlining how he/she works, preferences
		  (methods of contacting the professor/TA), methods of studying, attitude
		  towards online based applications/resources that might be used in the
		  course etc...
		  The other student personas that constrasts the student mentioned above
		  must be one that reflects a persona who is struggling in the course with
		  realistic cases that might explain why and the other persona is the one
		  who reflect a student who excels in the course and/or is hard working.

		**Each personas must holds a full complete description

Completed only the main points of the personas and only the details of the personas
are not yet finalized and will be completed on the next meeting.

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 1:51:33

|---------------------------------(end #3)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 4 (October 14, 2017):

Started to finalize and fix up the personas that were created from the last
meeting, and updated the 'Personas_UserStories.pdf' file. Removed un-needed
details with ones that realistically reflect users who will be using the
developed application. Captured some personas attributes that reflects Sohee
Kang along with one other persona who contrasts a bit to Sohee as stats professor.

Also managed to finalize the 3 contrasting student personas to help develop this
appication, e.g.

      - a student who struggles in the class
      - an average student that represents the fair majority of the class
      - a student who excels in the class

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 1:12:16

|---------------------------------(end #4)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 5 (October 21, 2017):

Broken down user-stories into what needs to be broken down into separate tasks
first along with their corresponding task descriptions, dependency, and story
points. Each story point is worth ~1 hour of work. Created "Product Backlog" card
to hold all the personas, user-stories and decomposition of the user-stories into
tasks.

Visit trello to see updated changes metioned above.

Started on creating the burndown chart according to the ideal setup to accommodate
team work flow into always having something to be develop on each day and/or
finishing some assigned task -> (ensuring there is some progress to be made each
day).

Visit the mentioned burndown chart and development setup linked on Google Docs.

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 2:13:01

|---------------------------------(end #5)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 6 (October 22, 2017):

Discussed all the programming that has been done or need to be finished regarding
the user stories for the week 1 sprint and helped each other solve the problems
that each person faced while completing his or her task.

Updated the version number of personas_userstories.pdf to account for any changes
that were made to account for the newly created tasks for the user stories.

Combined all the new info like tasks, dependencies, descriptions of the first set
of user stories and the updated personas/user-stories into the file 'product_backlog'.

Created another file 'sprint_backlog' to display the sprint plan and the burndown
chart for week 1 sprint.

Pushed all changes including the android app to GitHub.

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 2:01:30

|---------------------------------(end #6)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 7 (October 24, 2017):

Updated the current file to show the path for the project and sprint backlog 
located on the top of the current 'README.md' file.

Discussed about the constraints with the development project as the database and
back-end needs to be updated for user-messaging and file/photo upload. Readjust-
ments to the plan had to be made.

Discussed about the next sprint plan for the upcoming development cycle. Updated 
the project and sprint backlogs to accommodate the next development cycle. The 
sprint burndown chart is updated and made agreements to accommodate for team-
members having other actives which reduces the amount of developments per-cycle.

Visit Google Docs to see updated sprint plan for more information.

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 0:55:45

|---------------------------------(end #7)---------------------------------------|

Meeting 8 (November 1, 2017):

Discussed about revisiting the implemenation of the database as a solution was found 
for the online database and local host. A full detail replanning for what must be 
changed and implemented for userstory tasks that depends on the remote database.

Assigned new task to each developer finalizing the what functions need to be changed
now that the database is added. e.g.

      - announcemnts
      - redsign the backend for the database to work with the remote server
      - creating problem sets and uploading them
      - downloading problem sets
      - uploading lecture notes 
        ... etc

        **Each feature has it's own branch -> branch by feature

Updated the sprint plan development cycle, product and sprint backlog with the 
most recent update changes, and burndown charts (with planned curve). Discussed 
about the current sprint plan as alot of changes need to be made with the remodeling
of the application that needs to work with the remote database without any major 
obstacles preventing/slowing down the progress of the project.

Visit Google Docs to view these changes.

 Duration (Hour:Minute:Second) := 1:20:49
