Meeting 2 (September 30, 2017):
Started on creating some user stories (Prof and student). Visit 'Trello Board'
to see the written user stories on backlog card. Narrowed down the main idea 
of how the project will precede during the development by reviewing the current 
stories with overlapping features directly or indirectly.

Ran into some complications with user stories/requirements and came up with
some questions for the client to get a better understanding of how to proceed 
with the current project.
  -> Requesting a meeting with the client (Professor) some time next week
     for some clarification of end-user requirements.
